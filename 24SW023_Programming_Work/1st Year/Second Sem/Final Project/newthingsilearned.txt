I am making this file to summarize the extra things i learned for anyone reading this

Volatile Keyword
this keyword is weird but important, when u have multiple threads, they might not see updated values without it. basically tells Java "always get fresh value from memory, don't use cached copy"
finally fixed that annoying bug where my thread wouldn't stop!

also found out how to make threads pause  Just do Thread.sleep(1000) to wait 1 sec. Have to put in try/catch block bc it might throw InterruptedException.

(Daemon Threads) this explains why my program wouldn't close Regular threads keep app running until they finish but daemon threads auto-close when main program ends.
just had to add:
thread.setDaemon(true); now my background tasks don't keep program running .figured it out after 3 hrs debugging :/
