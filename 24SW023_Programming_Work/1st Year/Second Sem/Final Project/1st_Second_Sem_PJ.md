# Virtual Pet Simulator

A Java console-based virtual pet simulation game that demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts. This project was developed as a final assignment for my first-year programming course.

## 🐾 About the Project

Virtual Pet Simulator allows you to create and care for different types of virtual pets in a simulated environment. Take care of dogs, cats, and birds by feeding them, playing with them, and ensuring they get enough rest. Each pet has realistic needs and stats that change over time, requiring your attention and care.

## 🧩 Features

- **Multiple Pet Types**: Create and customize dogs, cats, and birds with unique attributes
- **Real-time Pet Status**: Pet stats (hunger, energy, happiness) change over time
- **Interactive Activities**: Feed your pets, play with them, and let them sleep
- **Pet-specific Actions**: Special activities for each pet type (dogs can fetch, cats can chase string, birds can fly)
- **Food Management**: Buy different types of food and maintain a food inventory
- **Status Monitoring**: Receive warnings when your pets need attention

## 💻 Technical Highlights

This project demonstrates several key object-oriented programming principles:

- **Inheritance**: Pet subtypes inherit from an abstract base class
- **Polymorphism**: Different implementations of abstract methods for each pet type
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with getter methods
- **Abstraction**: Abstract base class defines the structure for concrete implementations
- **Composition & Aggregation**: Environment contains pets, pets contain food items
- **Multi-threading**: Background thread monitors pet status in real time

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Compile all Java files
3. Run the VirtualPetSimulator class
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to create and care for your virtual pets

## 🎓 Educational Value

This project was created to demonstrate my understanding of:
- Object-oriented design principles
- Java programming fundamentals
- Multi-threading  
- User input handling
- Console-based UI development

## 📝 Future Improvements

- Add a graphical user interface
- Implement pet growth and evolution
- Add more pet types and activities
- Create a save/load system
